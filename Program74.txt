Five programs of the project
The program will be attended by students who study at the institute in the direction of "Applied Informatics" in the profiles "Development of web and mobile applications", "Development of computer games and applications with virtual and augmented reality", as well as students of the direction "Business Informatics" in the profile "IT Project Management".
For the development of applications and games, in addition to programmers, designers, project managers and analysts are needed. After all, the design work completely imitates the production process. Therefore, the program includes students of the direction "Management" on the training profile "Business Management and Internet Marketing".
This year, the MIDIS opened a set for a new profile in Design at college and university: Web Design and Mobile Development, where you can enter without passing mathematics. This is a program in which students will learn how to design websites and mobile applications, create animation and motion graphics, as well as program full-featured websites and mobile applications in No-code applications.
MIDIS prepares not just a graduate, but a graduate with at least three years of work experience and a solid portfolio
